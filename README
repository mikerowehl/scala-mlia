Some hacking around with machine learning in Scala. I'm trying to learn me
some Scala, and at the same time try to understand some of the machine
learning concepts a bit better. So I'm working through the examples from
Machine Learning in Action (http://www.manning.com/pharrington/) and making
Scala versions to play with. The book is available on Safari if you already
have a subscription (http://my.safaribooksonline.com/).

The examples build on top of breeze (https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze), but
I'm fairly sure I'm not really using that library the way it's really intended
to be used. So for now at least these aren't great samples for that case.

This also isn't really meant to be used as a library, just a set of examples.
